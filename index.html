    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
      In a dark, dark wood there was a dark, dark house.
      With the dark, dark woods.
      There was a giant catdog with monkeybread.
      And an oversized unicorn with magical dust.
      The dust blew into the monkey bread and killed the dog, but not the cat.
      The cat ran and found the unicorn. Unfortunately, unicorns love cats. So, he ate the cat's food.
